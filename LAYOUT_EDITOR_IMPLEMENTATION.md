## 🎯 New Layout Editor System - Implementation Summary

### ✅ **Completed Implementation:**

**🖥️ Layout Editor Modal:**
- 3-column design with visual grid, action buttons, and tile selection
- 5×3 grid display with clickable squares
- Available tiles panel with descriptions and sizes
- Place (←) and Remove (→) action buttons

**🎮 User Workflow:**
1. Click Layout Editor button (📐) in header
2. Select a tile type from right panel (shows size and description)  
3. Click a grid square (highlights selection area)
4. Click ← Place button to add tile (with validation)
5. Click → Remove button to remove tiles
6. Apply or Cancel changes

**💾 Configuration Management:**
- Save current layouts with custom names
- Load previously saved configurations
- Delete unwanted configurations
- Configurations stored in localStorage

**🔍 Smart Validation:**

- Visual feedback (red wobble animation for invalid placements)
- Size preview (shows tile footprint when selected)

**🎨 Visual Features:**
- Color-coded occupied grid squares by tile type
- Real-time preview of tile placement areas
- Clear error messages for invalid operations
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### 🧪 **Testing Instructions:**

2. **Open Layout Editor**: Click the 📐 button in top-right header  
3. **Test Tile Placement**:
   - Select "Calendar" (2×2 tile) from right panel
   - Click top-left grid square (1,1) 
   - Click ← Place button → Should place successfully
   - Try placing another 2×2 tile overlapping → Should show error

4. **Test Different Sizes**:
   - Select "Weather" (2×1 tile) 
   - Place in available space
   - Select "Time" (1×1 tile) and fill gaps

5. **Test Removal**:

   - Click → Remove button → Should remove tile

6. **Test Configuration**:
   - Create a layout with multiple tiles
   - Click Apply to see it on dashboard
   - Click 💾 button to open config manager
   - Save layout with a name
   - Create new layout and load saved one

### 🔧 **Key Functions Implemented:**

- `openLayoutEditor()` - Opens modal and initializes editor
- `generateGridSquares()` - Creates 5×3 interactive grid
- `generateAvailableTiles()` - Populates tile selection panel
- `selectGridArea()` - Handles grid square selection with preview
- `selectTileType()` - Handles tile selection from panel
- `placeTile()` - Places tile with validation
- `removeTile()` - Removes tiles from grid
- `applyLayout()` - Applies editor layout to dashboard
